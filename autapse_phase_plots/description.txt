This folder will contain an attempt at plotting the phase portrait of the autaptic neuron. 

It will need to be 3-dimensional and the autaptic current will be treated as a time-varying addition
to the injected current.
Generally, a plot of v-u. 
- Flow field
- nullclines corresponding to df/dt = 0
- equilibria?
- In this case a 3rd dimension might be useful for time as the autaptic parameter is time-varying.
- How to show limit cycle attractors? These might show up in the flow field...

* This may serve as a helpful way of understanding how autaptic parameters work together
    1) large e scenario: autaptic current decays very rapidly, essentially a jolt of the membrane potential up or down.
    2) small f scenario: autaptic current is essentially negligible and doesn't result in a major change. Is relative to I_inj anyway.

* autapse would effectively produce a time-varying shift of the v-nullcline (up or down, depending on excitatory or inhibitory). 
Presumably a bifurcation has already occurred, so we are now looking at bifurcations of limit cycles (izhikevich chpt 6.2).

Might be interesting to use *plotly* for interactive 3d plots. 

Not really sure how to visualise. The whole 3D space will change depending on the input current. Could make this a slider?

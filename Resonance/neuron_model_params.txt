Some description of the model neuron parameters including the reference cortical neuron and 
the bifurcations that occur

Can switch from RS to IB to CH (below) by simply changing c and d. These describe the effects of high-threshold 
inward and outward currents. Increasing c up-regulates slow Na currents, or down-regulates slow K+ currents.

Neocortical neurons in vivo can swtich their firing classes depending on the state of the brain.

Bifurcations:
    - saddle-node on invariant cycle (RS with b <~0, possibly IB and CH?)
    - subcritical Andronov-Hopf (RS b > 0, LTS, FS)
    - saddle-node off invariant cycle (SPN)
    * no model with a supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation.



Regular Spiking (RS) - cortical pyramidal neurons

    RS = {'name': 'RS', 'C': 100, 'k': 0.7, 'v_r': -60, 'v_t': -40, 'v_peak': 35,
         'a': 0.03, 'b': -2, 'c': -50, 'd': 100}    

    For b < 0 or b ~ 0 (i.e fig. 8.12 (b = -2) and fig. 8.14 (b = 0.5)):
    - Pure Integrator
    - Class 1 excitability.
    - saddle-node on invariant circle bifurcation (@ I = 52 pA and I = 75 pA).
    - fig. 8.12 is from L5 rat visual cortex.

    For b > 0 (i.e. fig. 8.15 (b = 5)):
    - Resonator
    - Class 2
    - big saddle homoclinig orbit bif. (@ I = 124.5 pA)
    - saddle homoclinic orbit bifurcation (@ I = 126.5 pA), the system is bistable between 124.5-126.5 pA
    - subcritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation (@ I = 127.5 pA), only spiking limit cycle beyond this point.

Intrinsic Bursting (IB) - cortical pyramidal neuron.

    IB = {'name': 'IB', 'C': 150, 'k': 1.2, 'v_r': -75, 'v_t': -45, 'v_peak': 50,
         'a': 0.01, 'b': 5, 'c': -56, 'd': 130}

    IB_dendrite = {{'name': 'IB_dendrite', 'C': 150, 'k': 3., 'v_r': -70, 'v_t': -45, 'v_peak': 50,
         'a': 0.01, 'b': 5, 'c': -52, 'd': 240}} -> this model then has a dendritic compartment which contribute inflow of current.

    - At weak stimulation, the neuron exhibits Regular Spiking responses with lower frequency, higher rheobase, 
    shorter latency, and afterdepolarization...
    - At stronger stimulation, the neuron emits a burst of spikes which turns to tonic spiking. Burstiness can vary.
    - bursting can be induced by excessive inward current (or not enough outward current) at the start of a 
     spike train
    - bursting can also be induced by a backpropagating action potential (waveform similar to autapse, maybe slower)
    - No mention of specific bifurcations, possibly the same as in RS.
    * Is it possible to fit an autaptic neuron to produce instrinsic bursting (as in 2-compartment example, chapter 8)

Chattering (CH) - cortical pyramidal neuron

    CH = {'name': 'CH', 'C': 100, 'k': 0.7, 'v_r': -60, 'v_t': -40, 'v_peak': 35,
         'a': 0.03, 'b': -2, 'c': -40, 'd': 100}

    CH = {'name': 'CH', 'C': 50, 'k': 1.5, 'v_r': -60, 'v_t': -40, 'v_peak': 25,
         'a': 0.03, 'b': 1, 'c': -40, 'd': 150}

    - RS neuron can be transformed into a CH neuron by increasing the post-spike reset c - -40 mV.
    - implied to exhibit the same bifurcations? Also by varying b about different points?

Low-Threshold Spiking (LTS) Interneurons - cortical interneurons

    LTS = {'name': 'LTS', 'C': 100, 'k': 1, 'v_r': -56, 'v_t': -42, 'v_peak': 35,
        'a': 0.03, 'b': 8, 'c': -50, 'd': 100}

    - Behave like RS with b > 0 (resonators, subcrit. AH bifurcation).
    - Transition from integrators to resonators (see fig. 8.15)

Fast Spiking (FS) Interneurons - cortical interneurons
    * Might require an adapted model, but not necessarily...
    FS = {'name': 'FS', 'C': 20, 'k': 1, 'v_r': -55, 'v_t': -40, 'v_peak': 25,
         'a': 0.2, 'b': -2, 'c': -45, 'd': 0}
     -> u-nullcline is nonlinear in practice.

    - fast, tonic spike trains of constant amplitude and frequency.
    - Tateno et al. (2004) showed they have class 2 excitability (discontinuous F-I)
    - Injecttion of DC current creates a subHopf/fold cycle bifurcation (creation of a stable and unstable limit cycle).
    - subthreshold oscillations and stuttering near threshold suggest a subcritical AH bifurcation.
    - Model implemented in AQUA does not fire PIR spikes, this isn't always the case as shown by Tikidji-Hambury 2015
    where the ability of FS neurons to produce PIR was shown.

Spiny Projection Neurons of Neostriatum and Basal Ganglia

    SPN = {'name': 'SPN', 'C': 50, 'k': 1, 'v_r': -80, 'v_t': -25, 'v_peak': 40,
         'a': 0.01, 'b': -20, 'c': -55, 'd': 150}

    - saddle node off invariant cycle bifurcation.
    - switches between hyperolarized (down) state and a depolarized (up) state.

Mesencephalic V Neurons of the Brainstem
    * Requires an adapted model.
    - Classic example of resonators with fast subthreshold oscillations, class 2 excitability, rebound spikes, etc...
    - subcritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation.

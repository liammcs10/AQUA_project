Investigate the transition from RS neurons to IB using only autaptic feedback. 
Compare to descriptions of IB activity from izhikevich textbook


(1) Bursting at the start of a train, followed by tonic firing
    -> Easily done with simple autapse model

(2) Complex, repeating bursts (almost chattering)
    -> Slower biexponential autapse model.

(3) Bursts with increasing (or decreasing) ISIs
    -> Model autapse with synaptic depression (or facilitation) to create variable currents?
    -> Possibly multiple recovery timescales on the neuron? 

(4) Complex burst followed by tonic Bursting
    -> Biexponential autapse
    -> Super slow recovery current to block more bursts?

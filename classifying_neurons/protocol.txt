Testing the response properties of neurons with autapses.

Qs:
    * Can we remove the time delay? Put some value corresponding to synaptic 
    transmission + the rise time (0.3-0.5 ms).

Population:
    - One neuron type (FS, RS, etc...)
    - fix the decay constant for now (e = 0.3 => t = 3.33 s to reach 37% of the original value)
    - varying degrees of synaptic conductance measuring the 'extent' of the autapses.

Tests:
    - Apply various step currents and retrieve the steady state frequency -> F-I curve
    - Apply a single ramp (or multiple with different slopes?) -> F-I curve
    -

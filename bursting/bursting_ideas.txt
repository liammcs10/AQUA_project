Shown in brian2 that many properties of IB neurons can be more or less reproduced
using the RS neuron with autapse.

Here we start to investigate the computational properties 
(i.e. slope detection and encoding, or coincidence detection).
    -> ref. Kepecs et al. (2002) - "Bursting Neurons Signal Input Slope"

Will try to do this on the basic autapse model and get as far as possible with it.
* compare all results to standard RS neuron!

Parameters:
    RS = {'name': 'RS', 'C': 100, 'k': 0.7, 'v_r': -60, 'v_t': -40, 'v_peak': 35,
     'a': 0.03, 'b': -2, 'c': -50, 'd': 100, 'e': 0.2, 'f': 250., 'tau': 0.0}

     Can produce burst doublets. These preferentially occur for currents just above threshold (this is good)

Interesting idea: coupling pyramidal cell to an inhibitory neuron which receives the time series
can create the conditions in which bursting signals negative gradients
    -> mechanism: tonic drive to pyramidal neuron. downslope in time series creates a decrease
    in inhibitiion corresponding to an increase in excitation in the pyramidal cell.
